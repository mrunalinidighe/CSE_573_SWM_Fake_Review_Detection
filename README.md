# CSE_573_SWM_Fake_Review_Detection

Fake-Review-Detection
Detecting Fake Reviews from the Yelp Restaurant Reviews Dataset

We used three techniques to achieve the objective: Logisitic Regression, Random Forest and SVM. We also used PCA to reduce the dimensions and get the features. We used the Yelp Dataset which has data on several restaurants. Furthermore, we worked with multiple machine learning techniques and gradually improved the accuracy.We are using BERT which stands for Bidirectional Enconder Representations from Transformers which uses transformer based machine learning.Bert uses wordpiece tokenizer to split words into tokens.

The repository is divided into folders as follows:
